"""
Personalized Education and Career Pathfinder Agent - Improved Portia Integration

Key improvements based on actual Portia SDK behavior:
1. Removed problematic structured_output_schema usage where it fails
2. Better handling of Portia's planning and execution flow
3. Improved result extraction from actual Portia responses
4. Strategic use of structured outputs only where they work
5. Better error handling for Google Gemini API issues
